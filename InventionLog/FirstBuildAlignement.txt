We are building one customer-facing Xcode iOS app that runs in simulator today and is structured to ship through TestFlight. This release includes only that intake-to-10-docs surface plus the minimal server boundary it calls. No runtime console, multi-surface suite, or post-launch app-operations interface is in scope for this build. Each user session is a run, and a run is successful only when exactly ten documents for roles 1 through 10 are present and validated complete. The intake flow starts open-ended so users can describe intent naturally before rigid structure appears. It then moves into constrained confirmations with explicit alignment checkpoints, including multiple-choice moments, before meaning is locked. The system never silently invents critical meaning, and unresolved ambiguity stays visible as UNKNOWN until explicitly confirmed. Every claim in every document carries a trust label of USER_SAID, ASSUMED, or UNKNOWN plus provenance pointers to intake turns or decision events. Users can view all ten documents in-app before they are allowed to finalize. The app provides a Submit action that finalizes a reviewed run and requests creation of a submission bundle artifact. On Submit, the server packages the ten documents with a manifest containing run_id, user_id, timestamps, and document metadata into one zip file. That zip is uploaded to a Supabase Storage bucket such as shipfirst-submissions as the canonical handoff artifact. The operator workflow is only this: operator downloads the zip from Supabase Storage via the Supabase dashboard Storage UI with admin access, and no second customer-facing surface is introduced. Supabase is the persistence boundary for auth, per-user isolation, run history, and storage and retrieval of documents and submission bundles, while the iOS client ships only the Supabase URL and anon key. All LLM calls happen server-side through Edge Functions or equivalent with secrets stored in Supabase, and the app includes a blank-canvas reset that clears local draft state without deleting stored run history.
