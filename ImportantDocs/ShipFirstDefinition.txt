ShipFirst: One-Document Definition 
ShipFirst is a platform that turns a rough app idea into a clear plan, then delivers a working app and owner controls.
It is built on one principle: customers should not need to know how software is built to get software that feels like theirs.
1. Product Promise
	1	You describe your app in plain language.
	2	ShipFirst asks a short set of smart follow-up questions.
	3	ShipFirst produces 3 simple planning documents that feel personal, clear, and buildable.
	4	ShipFirst builders deliver the app and owner console.
	5	You run your app through ShipFirst infrastructure and control business details in your console.
2. What ShipFirst Is
	1	AWS-like in platform reliability and control-plane discipline.
	2	Shopify-like in owner control and business operation model.
	3	Loveable-like in understanding intent from minimal input.
	4	ShipFirst-like in execution: idea to plan to delivered app, without exposing implementation burden to the customer.
3. What Customers Receive From Intake
	1	App Vision Brief: what the app is, who it serves, what makes it special.
	2	MVP Blueprint: the core journey, launch scope, and trust expectations.
	3	Owner Control Brief: what ShipFirst will build vs what the owner will customize later.
These 3 docs are readable by non-technical users and actionable for internal builders.
4. Intelligence Model
	1	Intake runs as a guided conversation: one question at a time, mostly multiple choice, with optional free text.
	2	The system stores conversation meaning as structured facts plus embeddings.
	3	Retrieval is used to keep context, resolve ambiguity, and ask the highest-impact next question.
	4	Readiness is binary: Not ready or Ready.
	5	If intent is clear but some detail is missing, ShipFirst generates with explicit assumptions instead of blocking.
5. Platform Surfaces
	1	Intake Surface: captures intent and produces the 3-doc plan.
	2	Builder Surface (internal): turns plan into deliverable app.
	3	Owner Console: controls dynamic business settings after delivery.
	4	Runtime Apps: end-user experiences powered by ShipFirst.
	5	Platform Ops Surface: governance, observability, reliability, compliance.
6. Database Vision (One Spine for All Surfaces)
	1	One multi-tenant data backbone for intake, planning, build, runtime, and console.
	2	Canonical identity and ownership model across every entity.
	3	Event history plus current-state tables for auditability and speed.
	4	Versioned artifacts for every plan and change.
	5	Embedding memory layer tied to source records with provenance and freshness state.
	6	Strict tenant isolation, policy-based access, and service boundaries.
7. Enterprise Requirements
	1	Every important decision is traceable.
	2	Every generated statement can be labeled as confirmed, assumed, or open.
	3	Every surface is observable with correlation IDs and lifecycle events.
	4	Every schema and policy change is governed, testable, and reversible.
	5	Reliability and security are defaults, not add-ons.
8. Buildability Rule ShipFirst does not promise infinite complexity in v1. It promises high-confidence, fast-delivery apps with clear scope and strong personalization.
The intake system must always balance:
	1	Personal expression.
	2	MVP simplicity.
	3	Delivery speed.
	4	Platform safety.
9. Success Standard ShipFirst succeeds when a customer says:
	1	“This is my app idea, captured correctly.”
	2	“The plan is clear and exciting.”
	3	“I trust ShipFirst to build and run the hard parts.”
This is the invention: a scalable app-creation platform where intelligence makes planning feel effortless, and infrastructure makes ownership real.
